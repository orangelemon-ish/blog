	<h5>Avni Gupta is a teenager with opinions.</h5>
	
	<p>Avni (she/her) loves math, science (especially astronomy and psychology), history, and english. Basically school, so that's worked out pretty well so far. Outside of school, she's an avid reader, and enjoys learning about random things. Avni also loves to code, and is currently learning Java. Her talent for photography, funnily enough, only extends to mobile phones. </p>
