				<h1>Is the New Normal Just Normal?</h1>
			</div>
	</div>
	
	  <p>There's been a lot of talk about the "new normal" and whatnot, basically referring to how our entire lives have been upended, and I feel like by continuing to call it the new normal nearly four months into a pandemic is kind of overly idealistic and frankly, irrational. Moving is a new normal, yet it only seems like that for the first month or so before you begin to adjust. It's just normal then. 
	<br><br>
	And I can't say that I haven't gotten used to being at home, hardly ever leaving my street, and having my dad work from the dining room. At this point, we're not even trying to imitate normal, because this is what normal has become - endless Netflix and procrastination without an excuse and just <em>time</em>, endless time. So why is it still considered new? We adapt to changes constantly - on both an individual level and a societal one. We deal with moves and changing family dynamics and changing policies and presidents.
	<br><br>
	What I don't quite understand is why that doesn't apply to a pandemic. Why can't we adapt to this as quickly? 
	<br><br>
	I think that the structure of our society plays a role - we're so used to having (nearly) complete freedom, to feeling safe and being able to plan for the future, that we can't fully comprehend it when all that's upended. As compared to people in war zones, who have almost the opposite situation - they're so used to living in the moment and to coming to terms with the idea that there might not be a tomorrow that they're much more adapted to this sort of situation. 
			
			
			
			I suppose that this limits the things you can do, while a move is only a change of location, but why do we still insist on ignoring the fact of the pandemic? At the Tulsa Trump rally, people completely disregarded the free masks, and when asked, claimed that the coronavirus wasn't nearly as big of a deal as the media made it out to be. Even some of my family friends are going out to beaches and parties, entirely ignoring social distancing and masks. I suppose the question I'm asking is why a pandemic, a <em>disease</em> is such a partisan issue?
