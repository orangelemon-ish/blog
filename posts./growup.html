		<p>I'm no artist. Hopefully, you know this already. There is one art I do love, though, and that's photography (and music). The quality's really bad on this one, and I don't really know how to make it better, so you'll just have to take my word for it. <br><br>Anyways, Art That Represents The Pandemic. Basically we read this really good <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/t-magazine/art-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">article</a> that proves that the New York Times is literally the best. It connected art and pan/epidemics. Read it and feel enlightened.<br><br>So I've found just by existing that most pandemic art thus far is about how unnatural it is that tourist hot spots are deserted. And sure, I could do something like that. It'd be easy, with the literally no one anywhere. But I don't know. So I took some pictures and made a collage, as you do. Voila.<br><br>

		<br><br>Being me, I couldn't choose just one picture, so I chose five :-) The first one, yes, is the standard theme of 'goneness.' But it also reflects how human civilization has the ability to outlive the current situation. Not to brag, but the buildings - office buildings - seem almost majestic in the sun.<br><br>The second picture (top right), represents the fact of our fragility. We are the bubble, and like it, we can pop at any moment. And yeah, I get that these are conflicting messages, but this is a conflicted time, no?<br><br>The next picture down shows the world moving on without us as we watch it through the window.<br><br>On the bottom right, the playground and yard are deserted as we are finally forced to grow up and take action.<br><br>And the fifth photo expresses a bit of hope that we can grow between the cracks, that we can survive this.<br><br>Like my collage, a lot of the artwork created around the AIDS epidemic expressed somewhat contradictory messages - that dying for love was beautiful but stupid. This culture romanticizes dying for love (hahaha), makes it seem like something noble, something worth doing. But it's also incredibly stupid. Don't do it, kids.</p>
