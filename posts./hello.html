Hey y'all! Welcome to Coronavirus 2020: Death Is Imminent! So since this is my first post, I'm just gonna catch y'all up on what's been happening here in the lovely state of Connecticut. 
<br><br>
So the disease we all know and love, and the disease Google still says I'm spelling wrong even though it's a pandemic: COVID-19. Our amigo first came to China, then South Korea, then the Cruise Ship/Japan, then Iran, then Italy, and then the state of California. It soon spread to Washington and then New York, New York. Now, I live in Connecticut, right? So I was kinda offended that the Coronavirus seemed to be avoiding us! Like, you go to New York, and Rhode Island, and Long Island, and Massachusetts, but not Connecticut? You've got us surrounded! Now's the prime time to attack!
<br><br>
Eventually, though, mi amigo COVID-19 did come to the wonderland that is Connecticut, and our first case was like scary, but still not really such a big deal. But then there was some party, right? And a bunch of parents from my town and some neighbouring towns went to it, and they came into contact with someone who was corona-positive. Cue state-wide panic. And so, schools closed last Wednesday, and as such, I've mostly been sitting around my house with absolutely nothing to do but binge-watch Netflix and (re)read basically everything that's on my bookshelf. 
<br><br>
I also got a haircut on Wednesday, although my parents wanted to wait until after the Coronavirus. I told them that that'd be at least another month, so I did end up getting one. Afterwards, my mom and I went to the paradise that is Stop 'n' Shop. And yes, I know that's not how you spell it. Do you think I care?
<br><br>
Anyways, they had this table with like gloves and COVID info packets and whatnot near the entrance, and I thought that that was a really nice gesture. Kudos to Stop 'n' Shop. So then there's this old lady, right? And she's like "oh wow, look at this. This is so nice" and all, and that's totally cool, but then she starts to just take glove after glove after glove out of the little box. They had like two boxes, and this lady took like a full box, and I'm like "uh okay then you do you but the rest of us'd like some gloves too y'know." And like, there's people who are so paranoid as to go fighting with strangers over the last packet of toilet paper in Walmart.
<br><br>
Y'all, the internet exists for a reason! If you'd just look up symptoms of coronavirus, you'd find that diarrhea isn't one of them! There is no need for you to be stocking up on toilet paper! And if you do buy more than your fair share, all it means is that other people won't get theirs. And if we're going to survive this as a society, we need to ensure that everyone gets accommodated, everyone gets taken care of. Yeah, it's reasonable to buy a little more food than usual, but we can look out for ourselves while still making sure that others are secure as well. 
<br><br>
Not to get overly political here, but like, universal paid sick leave'd be nice. Y'know, so people don't come to work sick because they can't afford to lose their income. And I know that the House did pass a relief bill, so my thanks to the government for that. But I'm just worried that it won't be enough. Like Italy has such a strong healthcare system, and even it's getting overwhelmed. Is our system going to be enough? So many Americans aren't insured, and I fear for them. 
<br><br>
I mean, is it too much to ask that we all be taken care of?</p>
