				<h1>The Renaissance, The Reformation, and The Pandemic</h1>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>One of these things is not like the others. Pandemic starts with a 'P'. üòÅ But, you never know. What if Pandemic == Renaissance? Sorcery!
<br><br>
Well, at the most basic level, going outside was necessary for all three to spread. The Renaissance and Reformation to spread and exchange ideas, and the Pandemic to get people infected.
<br><br>
Jokes aside, though, the Renaissance and Reformation were both rebirths of sorts, right? Like the Renaissance was a rebirth of classical culture from like the Greeks and Romans and they basically revived knowledge, and the Reformation was a rebirth of religion and religious identity. Well, once the Pandemic is over, we're probably also going to face a rebirth.
<br><br>
Some background on the Renaissance first. It was basically the time period after the Middle Ages from like 1300-ish to 1600-ish that saw a ton of new developments, both in the sciences and humanities. In my opinion, though, one of the most important development was the way in which humanity's view of itself shifted. Throughout the Middle Ages, people were thought of as pretty much useless, with their one main goal being "get to heaven when I die." In the Renaissance, however, people started to think they had a worth and ability to transform the world they lived in, and this philosophy most likely was the root cause of most of the other developments to come. People were also more willing to question and challenge everything from the cosmos to religion, and they began to realize that they were capable of coming to their own conclusions, especially for religion. People began to have a new worth, in their own eyes and in the eyes of others.
<br><br>
And we're probably going to see something like that nearing the end of the Pandemic, whenever that comes. Like, four months ago, the general consensus was that people in public transportation or service were people to be looked down upon. At the very least, they were below you with your white-collar job and superior skill level. Now, though, the tables have turned. These low-wage workers in factories, public transportation, and service are literally keeping us alive. That includes people like nurses and personal aides who, I feel, don't get enough recognition for what they do either.
<br><br>
Yet, now that the public knows that the people risking their and their families' well-being to come to work every day so that we don't starve or drown in our own garbage, they're finally getting the respect they deserve. According to the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/essential-workers-lowest-paid_n_5e7bc7f7c5b6256a7a23e6f5" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>, grocery store workers are being promoted, and ‚Äúthanked for [their] service, [their] bravery even.‚Äù Society is finally recognizing this, and in some cases, is starting to push for better conditions for these workers, most of whom don't even have health care.
<br><br>
Thankfully, we're already starting to see better conditions, as companies from Trader Joe's to Target are offering $2 hourly wage increases. Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is offering essential workers the opportunity to complete a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/us/michigan-tuition-free-educational-program-essential-workers-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">college degree - free of cost</a>. We're seeing the view of essential workers shift from unskilled to, well, essential. Now the challenge is making it last.
<br><br>
What's fascinating, though, is the demographics of these essential workers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html?auth=login-google" target="_blank">Over half are women</a>, and the vast majority are among the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/essential-workers-lowest-paid_n_5e7bc7f7c5b6256a7a23e6f5" target="_blank">lowest-paid</a> workers in the country. And, as is pretty common knowledge, most of these workers are people of color. All people that the country sees as inferior in some way. Hopefully, through their status as essential workers, the view of these people will also change for the better, garnering them more respect and better conditions.
<br><br>
And from this, maybe their opinions, ideas, and needs will start to be taken more seriously, adding to the stream of invention and discovery.
<br><br>
The Pandemic has the potential to be a modern Renaissance, as the general perception of different people shift. People previously seen as unskilled or inferior are now the very people our lives depend upon. Hopefully, Michigan is the first of many benefits to come for the people keeping us alive.</p>
