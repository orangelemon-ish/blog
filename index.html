			<h3><a href="./posts./protests.html">It's About Time,But Why?</a></h3>
			<h4>06/04/2020</h4>
			<p>I want to take this post to talk about the George Floyd protests, I think. Like, I completely agree that it's past time that we start actively protesting, but I can't help but wonder, why now? These things have been happening for years. I'm pretty sure deaths by police brutality have hovered around 1,000 every year since they started counting them. And yeah, there's been the constant societal murmur about police brutality and racial dis....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./flies.html">Fly Lords</a></h3>
			<h4>05/22/2020</h4>
			<p>Completely unrelated, but the classic Lord of the Flies is . . . .really concerning. Like I'm really concerned for William Golding's mental state right now.<br>--SPOILERS BELOW--<br>Anyways, though. There are two main issues I have with the book. One, it's 100% inaccurate. Ac....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./future.html">Back To The Future</a></h3>
			<h4>05/08/2020</h4>
			<p>Great movie, isn't it? I think so. Our future, though, isn't nearly as exciting.<br><br>People are talking about going back to school in the fall, and some states are already opening up. It's like, have you ever even heard of a pandemic?</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./growup.html">Grow Up</a></h3>
			<h4>05/05/2020</h4>
			<p>I'm no artist. Hopefully, you know this already. There is one art I do love, though, and that's photography (and music). The quality's really bad on this one, and I don't really know how to make it better, so you'll just have to take my word for it. <br><br>Anyways, Art That Represents The Pandemic. Basically we read this really good article that proves that the New York Times is literally the best. It connected art and pan/epi....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./art.html">Art Is Fun</a></h3>
			<h4>05/04/2020</h4>
			<p>I wouldn't be writing this, only my history teacher is kind of making me. You see, art is not fun. Art makes no sense. It looks nice and probably has a meaning in there somewhere but I have no clue how to get to that message because it's buried under like fifteen layers of paint and a mass of artistic methods....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./usa.html">A World Without the US of A</a></h3>
			<h4>05/02/2020</h4>
			<p>So I think you'll find that the majority of things I write are to some extent, inspired by the New York Times, so kudos to them for being so awesome. Y'all are doing great.<br><br>Anyways, I get a bunch of newsletters from the Times, right? Among them is the Morning Briefings, which basically sum up the big headlines for the day. I'm waaaay behind on them and was trying to catch up today, when I cam....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./rome.html">If The World Ended Tomorrow, Would We Know It?</a></h3>
			<h4>04/30/2020</h4>
			<p>Probably Not. I mean, besides the historians and history students, no one's looking for parallels between us right now and the fall of Rome, or even the end of the Middle Ages, which might be more apt, considering it ended with the plague.
			</br><br>
			The fall of the US, and even the global society as we know it is inevitable. And that sounds conspiracy fanatic-esque, I know. But think about it! Every gre....</p>

			<h3><a href="./posts./renaissance.html">The Renaissance, The Reformation, and The Pandemic</a></h3>
			<h4>04/30/2020</h4>
			<p>One of these things is not like the others. Pandemic starts with a 'P'. üòÅ But, you never know. What if Pandemic == Renaissance? Sorcery!<br><br>Well, at the most basic level, going outside was necessary for all three to spread. The Renaissance and Reformation to spread and exchange ideas, and the Pandemic to get people infected...</p>
